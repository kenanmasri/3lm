## So what is this exactly?

3LM is a simple, interpreted language used alongside Python.

It is used for defining objects and structures, intended mainly to help write structured content fast and with ease.
Whether you are a scientist, a programmer or an educator, 3LM can be useful for you.

3LM is intended to be a structure language for a platform for education.
