## So what is this exactly?

3LM is a simple, interpreted language used alongside Python.

It is used for defining objects and structures, intended mainly to help write structured content fast and with ease.
Whether you are a scientist, a programmer or an educator, 3LM can be useful for you.

3LM is intended to be a structure language for a platform for education.

## Additional Ideas Include:

 - Examination questions auto-extraction from 3lm files. (Could be a plugin.)
 - Contributable plugins (contrib folder?)
 - Much more possibilities... See https://github.com/e3lm/e3lm/blob/master/e3lm.todo
